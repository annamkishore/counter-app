#---------------------------Pipeline-----------------------
State:
  done:
    1) create dockerfile(s): done for web, service
    2) create docker image: done, working image
    2.5) created local docker registry: done, and pushed image to local registry
      to use built-in registry.. good one.. https://microk8s.io/docs/registry-built-in
    3) create kube DD: done for web    #Create Kubernetes Deployment YAML files for each component
    4) create kube service: #Create a Kubernetes Service YAML file for the backend component to expose it internally within the cluster
      cmd> kubectl expose deployment counter-web-deployment  --type="LoadBalancer"
      now, should see counter-web-deployment in services, use the ClusterIP to access webapp
  in-progress:
    5) create kube ingress: #create a Kubernetes Ingress or LoadBalancer Service to expose the frontend component to the outside world
  todo:
    6) create kube secrets: #to store sensitive info like DB credentials or API keys
    7) create kube config maps: #to manage config files or env variables that need to be injected into the containers
    8) mongodb:
    9) ingress:
    10) observability:
  issues:
    issue 1 (fixed, i.e. bypassed): | #in web dockerfile
      Step 9/13 : COPY --from=build /app/dist .
      Error response from daemon: COPY failed: stat app/dist: file does not exist
